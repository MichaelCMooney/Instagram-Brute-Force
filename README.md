# Instagram-Brute-Force

The purpose of this script is to brute-force guess the passwords to Instagram accounts.


Specifics:
- Comes with 2 separate modes including a combination hack where you may know a username and not the password, as well as a random guessing approach for both usernames and passwords.
- The option to use a proxy is included. Update proxy.txt with your proxy.
- The combination option will require adding in a combination file with the username details you may already know.
- This will return whether an account is already banned or not.
- This can be run from any Python-enabled device and against any device that can use Instagram including mobile devices.
